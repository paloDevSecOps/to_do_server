The back end now consists of two services: api server and database.
you can either 
1. run both of them  locally 
2. run both of them in containers

Unless you need to 

### **Running the server with using docker compose is highly suggested**

you only need to:

1. Have docker, docker-cli, docker compose, docker-desktop (optional, but recommended) installed
2. Configure docker.env
3. run `docker compose up`
